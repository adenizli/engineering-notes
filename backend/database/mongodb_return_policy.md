## Problem Statement

When a document is created in MongoDB, the database returns the full document object. The key question is: how should this document be returned to clients in an enterprise-level application?

## Options Considered

**Option 1: Return the Full User Object**

-    The API directly returns the created `User` object.
-    Pros: The client immediately has access to all the details without making an additional request.
-    Cons: Potentially returns more data than the client immediately needs, which can increase payload size and expose sensitive fields if not properly sanitized.

**Option 2: Return Only the User ID**

-    The API only returns the newly created userâ€™s ID (e.g., `{ id: "..." }`).
-    Pros: Lightweight response, ensuring minimal data transfer and reducing potential exposure.
-    Cons: The client must make a follow-up request to fetch the full details, leading to two requests for essentially the same information.

## Questions Raised

**Question 1: Which approach is more efficient in enterprise-level applications?**  
Efficiency depends on the use case:

-    If the client always needs the full user details immediately (e.g., to display the user profile right after creation), returning the full sanitized object is more efficient.
-    If the client only needs confirmation of creation, returning just the ID is more efficient, as it avoids transferring unnecessary data.

**Question 2: How to handle the inefficiency of duplicate requests when redirecting to a `/:id` page after creation?**  
In this scenario, two requests may occur: one for creation and one for retrieval. To optimize:

-    **Best Practice:** Return a sanitized version of the created object in the creation response. This way, the client can use that data to immediately update the UI or redirect to the `/:id` page without a redundant request.
-    Alternatively, APIs can use **Location headers** in the response (e.g., `201 Created` with `Location: /users/:id`) along with a minimal payload. This is REST-compliant and lets the client decide whether to fetch full details.

**Question 3: Is there any time interval difference between both approaches?**

-    Returning the full object typically saves time in cases where the client needs the data immediately, as it avoids an extra network request.
-    Returning only the ID can slightly reduce server response time and payload size, but adds latency overall if the client has to fetch the object in a follow-up request.
-    In high-latency environments, the difference can be significant, favoring the first approach when full details are usually needed.

**Question 4: Is there any lightweight approach beyond these two options?**  
Yes, hybrid strategies exist:

-    Return a **minimal sanitized payload** with only critical fields (e.g., `id`, `username`, `email`) and exclude heavy or sensitive attributes.
-    Use **GraphQL or partial response APIs** where the client specifies which fields they need. This avoids over-fetching and unnecessary data transfer.

## Recommended Enterprise Approach

1. **Return a Sanitized User Object**: Include only necessary fields (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`) in the response. Exclude sensitive fields such as passwords, internal flags, or tokens.
2. **Use Location Headers**: Provide the canonical URL of the resource (`/users/:id`) in the response headers, aligning with REST best practices.
3. **Hybrid Flexibility**: Consider offering a lightweight response format (or GraphQL/partial field selection) for clients that need only limited information. This provides efficiency without redundancy.
