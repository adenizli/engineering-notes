# 📚 Engineering Knowledge Base

Welcome to my **personal engineering knowledge base**.\
This repository is where I collect and organize everything I learn across **backend, frontend, cloud, security, and system design**.

It’s not just code snippets—it’s a mix of **deep dives, best practices, attack mitigations, and architectural principles** that I want to keep for long-term reference.\
Think of it as a continuously evolving **engineering handbook**.

This work also contains my notes which are generated by AI assistants.

## 🏗️ Structure

```
/backend        → API design, service layers, NestJS/Express patterns
/frontend       → Next.js, UI state management, performance tuning
/cloud          → Infrastructure as code, scaling patterns, observability
/ai             → Tokenizers, ML concepts, applied AI in systems
```

## 🎯 Principles

This repo follows a few guiding principles:

1. **Security by Design** → Prevent leaks, enforce least privilege, constant-time checks.
2. **Sustainability** → Patterns that scale, not hacks.
3. **Clarity over Cleverness** → Code should be understandable, not just “smart”.
4. **Knowledge as Code** → Treat notes like source code: versioned, reviewed, improved.
5. **Keep it simple** → Don't overcomplicate things.

## 🚀 Vision

The goal is to build a **living engineering handbook** that I (and possibly others) can always come back to.\
Every time I learn something valuable—whether from backend debugging, frontend optimization, a cloud deployment, or a security issue—I push it here.

Over time, this repo becomes:

-    A **personal reference** for daily engineering work.
-    A **training ground** to onboard others faster.
-    A **knowledge archive** that doesn’t get lost in scattered notes.

## 📌 Usage

-    Browse through subjects for concept notes.
-    Feel free to add your own notes by creating PRs.

## 🧭 Final Note

This repository is not meant to be perfect (since I'm not a perfect engineer and still learning)—\
I am always open to update it and make it better.
